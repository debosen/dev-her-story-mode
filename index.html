<h2>Anushka and Dev's Story</h2>

<div id="story0" class="story visible">
  <h3>Chapter 1: The Bumble Spark ‚ú®</h3>
  <p>May 6th, a swipe changed everything. We matched. I smiled. And then... it began. I still remember the first note I sent you which was my favourite song by praagya called Khel and from there our conversation started. Your endsems were going on at that point of time and still you managed to find time for me which meant a ton to me. You were polite and kind from the get-go and your vibes were so bright that it shed light even on my dull vibes. Something clicked for me on the first day itself and I truly am grateful!</p>

<div id="story1" class="story">
  <h3>Chapter 2: Instagram & Butterflies</h3>
  <p>On May 13th, you gave me your Instagram. That was the moment the bumble app got deported to the trash folder XD and the chats started and I got lucky enough to get your snapchat on the same day only. I was elated beyond words and I went through your profile and each pic of yours idk how to explain but gave me a sense of relief. I was still unsure at that point of time as I still consider you to be out of my league pretty and beautiful. But slowly and gradually the chats got deeper and the vibe‚Äîundeniable.</p>
  <p>What did you feel when we started talking?</p>
  <button class="choice" onclick="next('story2a')">A Bit of Unsurety</button>
  <button class="choice" onclick="next('story2b')">Like I Knew You Already</button>
  <button class="choice" onclick="next('story2c')">Pure Curiosity and Excitement</button>
</div>

<div id="story2a" class="story">
  <h3>The Unspoken Click</h3>
  <p>A tad bit of unsurety is a very normal reaction but what matters is the nature of conversation that upholds and I hope I was able to give you a safe space which I always will and I am very very grateful for your patience with me and you truly are a kind soul. I hope the unsurety has faded away by now but if it is still there sitting in a corner don't worry I am here with you and we will drive it away together as a team! As for my end, I never was unsure as something had clicked instantly and I was able to feel your kindness from the get-go <3 </p>

<div id="story2b" class="story">
  <h3>Kindred Spirits</h3>
  <p>I know this is a fairy-tale thing but this is the answer I would go for and if you are here as well I do believe in the concept of soulmates and the invisible string theory but I know it was more of an effort from your end to connect that string to me and I promise you I won't let it break ever. I hope you stay with me forever and everyday I wake with the same excitement of speaking with you and your mere presence in my life will ensure this excitement stays. As for me, I am never leaving your side and will love you always and my love for you only grows day by day <3</p>

<div id="story2c" class="story">
  <h3>Excited Heartbeats</h3>
  <p>Was it more curiosity or was it excitement that overshadowed the former? For me, it excitement was the winner as my heart raced every time a text from 'nushfr' popped up. I was curious too to know about you, your life and things you shared with me. I cherished each and every thing you told and I remembered the tiniest of details and I still do and will do! As for your end of the answer I expect it be over the calls we have :) and yes you can tell me whatever you feel <3 </p>
